OBSOLETE, SINCE THE REPOSITORY NOW USES GIT.

These notes are about the version control system I have been using to develop computer software for Babikow. The programs produce Microsoft Excel importable, external data files from various reports generated by their RealWorld accounting system.

The rest of this section should be copied to form the (unversioned) file, C:\Mark-develop\README.txt:

To pick up development using Mark-develop on Windows:
o. Get the compressed file SVN.zip.
o. Make a folder, 'C:\Mark-develop' and unzip it there.
o. Make sure Subversion has been installed (at least version 1.4.5, from http://subversion.tigris.org/).
o. Enter the following on a command line (changing for wherever Subversion was installed):
   C:\progra\subversion\bin\svn checkout file:///C:/Mark-develop/SVN/trunk/Repository-notes C:\tmp\notes
o. For further instructions, please read whatever files you find in the folder, 'C:\tmp\notes'.
o. Enjoy!
#----------------------------------
Assuming you already have performed the steps above from README.txt:
o. Possibly an NT-tree version of Windows is needed, such as XP, per the Windows section of the download page (http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html): 'The client runs on Win9x/Me but the server does not'.
o. Get the compressed file, 'static.zip'.
o. Unzip it to the folder, 'C:\Mark-develop'.
o. Make sure RapidSVN has been installed (at least version 0.9.4, from http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/).
o. In RapidSVN, do Menu-Bookmarks-Add existing repository of the URL, 'file:///C:/Mark-develop/SVN'.
o. Restart RapidSVN if necessary.
#----------------------------------

Using Subversion version 1.4.5.
Using RapidSVN version 0.9.4 built with Subversion version 1.3.2 (per the website, http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/) or 1.4.2 (per Menu-Help-About).

Create the repository with the option to, 'use format compatible with Subversion versions earlier than 1.4'.
Create the repository with the command:
svnadmin create C:/Mark-develop/SVN --pre-1.4-compatible --fs-type fsfs

The following is in RapidSVN:
Set the programs with Menu-View-Preferences-Programs:
notepad.exe or "C:\Program Files\EditPlus 2\editplus.exe", explorer.exe, comp

Import into the repository by Menu-Repository-Import, using the same repository URL and this path:
C:/Mark-develop/import/

Checkout a new working copy by right clicking on the repository, or by Menu-Repository-Checkout from the URL,
'file:///C:/Mark-develop/SVN/trunk'
to the path,
'C:/Mark-develop/checkout/trunk'.

Move files in the repository by typing the destination complete path and file name (to avoid bug).

Make tags (versions) by, in the repository, clicking on the root in the left pane, selecting 'trunk' in the right pane, and Menu-Modify-Copy, and for the destination, type the path and nonexistent folder name, such as:
file:///C:/Mark-develop/SVN/tags/Sales-volume-v0.1

To run development tests, open a command line window and change the current directory to 'C:\Mark-develop\checkout\trunk\RealWorld-Excel'. Then change to whatever subdirectory is for the tested program.
