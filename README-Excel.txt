All you need, in order to get a RealWorld report into Excel, is to do the
following:

o.) Run the appropriate RealWorld-Excel program, by double-clicking on its
program shortcut (see its README.txt).

o.) Double-click on the Excel template shortcut to get the column titles (see
below).

o.) On Excel's menu, click, 'Data...Import External Data...Import Data'
to import (as external data) from the program's output file,
'Report Columns.txt'
found in the program's output folder (see its README.txt).

The program's output is tab-delimited. In answering Excel's question, 'Where do
you want to put the data?' it is good to use the suggested default, cell '$A$2'.
----------------------------

Also useful is to make another shortcut (on your desktop) to the Excel template
file, as follows:

The titles of the columns for the spreadsheet are in the Excel template file,
'Titles.xlt'
in the folder where the program resides (see its README.txt).
Double-clicking in Windows Explorer to open this template is good, as then
Excel should ask for another file name if you save the resulting spreadsheet.
