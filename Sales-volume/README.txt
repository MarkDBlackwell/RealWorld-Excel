'RealWorld-Excel-Sales-Volume' is a computer program which does the following:

Extract, for Excel spreadsheet work, some information from a RealWorld report
(the Input) entitled,

'Fast analysis by customer sales volume'.

RealWorld should be asked to make its TEXT version of this report.

The text report may be run by selecting,
'year-to-date',
'ALL customers requested', and
'sales volume cut-off-level: NONE'.

The program's output folder is,
'U:\RW-Excel\Sales-volume\NNNN\'

NOTE: 'NNNN' represents different numbers that RealWorld generates each time it
runs a report. This is found in the page heading.

For reference, the non-detail lines (the page heading and the grand total
summary) from this run of the RealWorld report are extracted into the file,
'Report Headings.txt', in the program's output folder.

All you need, in order to columnize the above RealWorld report and get it into
Excel, is to do the following:

o.) Run this program by double-clicking on its program shortcut (explained

o.) Follow further instructions in README-Excel.txt.
